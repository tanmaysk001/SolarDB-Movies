# SolarDB-Movies
Here, I have used the code in the colab jupyter notebook file to create videos from the solar flare images. 

The Jupyter notebook contains various functions for image processing, I have used different combinations of all those functions after testing on all the movies in order to get the best results.

The movies folder contains the movies that I have created
